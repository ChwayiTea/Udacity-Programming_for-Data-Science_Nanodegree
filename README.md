# Udacity-Programming_for-Data-Science_Nanodegree

This repository contains all three projects of the course "Programming for Data Science using Python"

Introduction

This course gives basic idea of data analysis projects where where we will be doing some analysis using SQL or Python and then visualization using python libraries.

In the course we had a total of 3 projects covering the basics of SQL, Python for Data Science and Github.
The projeczts are as follows:

Project 1: Investigate Relational Database

Overview

In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

Project 2: Analyse US Bikeshare Data

Overview

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Requirements

This program was written in Python (version 3.7.1) and relies on the following libraries:

pandas==0.23.4
numpy==1.15.4

Project 3: Github Command Documentation

Overview

To put what you've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git.
